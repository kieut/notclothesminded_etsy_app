"""These measurements are in one line, so waist is pulling from the word next to it. I think I need to make an exception if 'and' follows 'waist'

The dress is approx. 48" at the bust, 40" waist and 48" hips (hips are taken at the bottom of the peplum detail at the waist), please allow yourself and inch or two for a proper fit.

The dress is 18" from mid shoulder to waist, and 46" long.  Features cocktail length sleeves and the interesting peplum detail that wraps almost all the way around (see photo of the back of the dress).  Really nicely made, it has belt loops but is missing its original belt.
